## Yet Another Config Library (YACL) Wiki

Yet Another Config Library (YACL) is a config screen generator that helps developers create a user-friendly GUI in Minecraft to allow users to configure their mods easily. YACL's functionality has also grown to also include an API to help developers save and load their config from a file.

<div className={"flex flex-row justify-center flex-wrap max-w-full md:flex-col"}>

</div>

The best way to tell you what YACL is all about is with an image. A picture speaks a thousand words!

### Why does it even exist?

This mod was made to fill a hole in this area of FabricMC modding. The already-existing config libraries don't achieve what I, as the developer, want from them.

- [**Cloth Config**](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config) **is stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features, they don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))

- [**Spruce UI**](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI) **isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence, the design feels cluttered.

- [**MidnightLib**](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib) **has cosmetics built-in.** It may not be large in size, but players (including me) may not want bundled cosmetics.

- [**OwO Lib**](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib) **contains a lot of other utilities.** It isn't focused on config, however, is recommended if you are building a content mod.

As you can see, there's sadly a drawback with every one of them. This is where YACL comes in!

### How is YACL better?

YACL has the benefit of hindsight. It can see what everyone else has done, and combine the best parts to make this a great contender. Here are a few points that may convince you:

- **Easy-to-use API:** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)'s internal configuration library.

- **Minecraft styled:** YACL is designed to fit right in vanilla Minecraft so it doesn't look out of place.

## âœ… When should I use it?

YACL was primarily designed with client mods in mind (mods that do not support loading on the server) so they can quickly produce a great UI for users, so these types of mods are recommended.

Additionally, mods that are required on both environments to function are also supported with its config API available, so the server so administrators can configure with a file, whilst the client can configure with a GUI. However, no server-client syncing functionality is available for use which may limit functionality of your mod. If you need server-client syncing, you will need to create your own implementation.
